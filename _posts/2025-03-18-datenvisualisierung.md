## 📊 Data Visualization – A university project from my early coding days

**Student Demographics Visualization** was a university project from 2013 that visualized freshman enrollment data across German federal states. The application was developed as part of a data visualization course and provides interactive exploration of demographic trends in the German higher education landscape.

### 🎓 How the visualization worked

The interface was designed to be intuitive and information-rich:

- **Interactive map**: Shows all German federal states with color-coded demographic representation
- **Timeline slider**: Allows browsing through enrollment data from winter semester 1998/99 to 2011/12
- **Detail views**: When selecting a state, detailed statistics are displayed with absolute numbers and percentages

The visualization uses color-coded human figures to represent different demographic groups, with the number of figures proportional to the percentage of students in each category.

### 💻 Implementation & Features

- 🗺️ Interactive map of all German federal states
- 📈 Time-series data visualization spanning over a decade
- 🔍 Filtering and selection by federal state
- 👥 Demographic breakdown by gender (male/female)
- 🌍 Distinction by origin (domestic/international students) *(Note: Terminology reflects the 2013 standards)*
- 📊 Visual representation of percentages using proportional figure counts
- 📋 Detailed view with exact numbers and percentage distributions

### 🔧 Technology Stack

- ☕ Java with [Processing](https://processing.org/) framework
- 📁 CSV data import and parsing
- 🎨 Configurable color schemes for different data types
- 🖱️ Interactive UI elements for data exploration

**Interactive state selection**: The application allows selecting individual states (here Baden-Württemberg) to view their specific enrollment data.

**Timeline exploration**: The user interface enables stepping through different time points to visualize changes in student enrollment patterns across years.

**Data processing**: The application imports data from structured CSV files containing information about federal states, semesters, and demographic characteristics.

### ⏱️ Historical Context Note

This application was developed in 2013 as a university project and should be viewed within its technological and linguistic context of that time. In particular, the terminology used (such as "Ausländer" for international students) reflects the standards of 2013 and would be expressed differently in contemporary projects using more inclusive language standards.

Looking back at this project, it demonstrates early skills in data visualization and interactive design that remain relevant, while showing how both technology and language conventions have evolved over time 📊
